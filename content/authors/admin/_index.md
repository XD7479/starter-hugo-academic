I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Bloomberg Distinguished Professor <a href="https://cogsci.jhu.edu/directory/alan-yuille">Alan Yuille</a>. 

My research interests currently lie in the field of weakly-supervised learning and robustness in computer vision.
